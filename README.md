TCG Organizer provides a simple GUI for scanning cards, browsing your collection, and analyzing sales data. The application uses a Tkinter-based interface and relies on optional Azure theme assets located in the `assets/config` directory.

## Running the application

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and launch the main menu:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The main menu lets you choose between scanning cards, viewing your collection, or analyzing Shoper sales.
